VCS --> version control system
    for tracking changes in computer files

        Features :
            Distributed version control
            Coordinates work between multiple developers
            Who made what changes and when
            Revert back at anytime
            Local and remote repos

Note: you don't have to connect to internet for working in local repos
      we need to connect to internet for pushing to remote repos

Concepts of Git
    Keeps track of code history
    Takes "snapshots" of your files
    you decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
    you can visit any snapshot anytime
    you can stage  files before committing



Some important commands in Git
    git init -> Initialize local git repo
    git add -> Add file(s) ti index
    git status -> check status of working tree
    git commit -> commit changes into index
    git push -> push to remote repository
    git pull -> pull latest code form remote repository
    git clone -> clone repository into a new directory

Installing git
    Linux(Debian)
        sudo apt-get install git
    Linux(Fedora)
        sudo yum install git
    Mac
        http://git-scm.com/download/mac
    Windows
        http://git-scm.com/download/win

Git Bash(Command line tool) gives the linux experience in Windows

use touch Command for creating file 
    touch Index.html --> this will create an file in given directory

below are commands for initializing your local project into remote git repository
    git init -> initializes local git repository

    we can also add git username and email in git bash by using commands
        git config --global user.name '<user name>'
        git config --global user.email '<Email>>'
    
    git add <file name> will add files to stage area
    we can check the files that are added to git by using command 
        git status
    we can also remove added files from staging area by using command
        git rm --cached <file name>
    we also can add same file types using 
        git add <*.html> -> this will add all html files
    to add all files in local repo
        git add .
    again if you change anything in any file you can check by using
        git status -> this will show all changed files
    we one have special process for committing by typing below command  
        git commit <Enter>
        this will take you to a interface you can add message 
            the line that starts with # will be ignored in commit
            we can go into controls by using insert button
            to get out from insert mode  we need to type <Esc> button 
                then type :wq to get out of prompt
    we can skip whole above process by simply typing 
        git commit -m "<commit message>"
    we can also make git to ignore some files by using .gitIgnore file
        git touch .gitIgnore    
        add file names with extension to be ignored by git
        we can also add folder in gitignore file to be ignored
        we can also include like *.txt or *.html files for ignoring given types of files in commit
    
    we can also separate our code by using branching
Note : whenever you are switching to new branch make sure that you must commit to current branch

        for creating new branch
        git branch <branch name>
